 <title>Tools for J</title>
</head><body>
Please download <a href="Jay.zip">Jay.zip</a>
and unzip it so that you can:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load 'Tools.ijs'<br>
Alternately, you can copy the files in Jay/config into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jpath '~user/config'<br>
and modify folders.cfg so Tools.ijs is loaded whenever you begin J
<p>
Once you have loaded Tools.ijs by either means, type:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. To see a list of what is available
<p>
Several areas are worth exploring:
<p>
Programmers familiar with other languages, may choose to begin with the strings collection, listed at the bottom of Tools
<p>
Programmers familiar with APL, may wish to explore modifying things from the session and then:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fun=. verb Del&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. After copying code from the screen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now=. noun Del&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. After copying text from the screen<p>
<p>
Sorting in dictionary order is something that APL programmers will be familiar with, but just about anyone will benefit from a more intuitive sequence.
This is especially true if you've ever seen a list of things like:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a1 a12 a2 a23<br>
instead of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a1 a2 a12 a23<br>
Try:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort ;:'a1 a12 a2 a23'
<p>
If you like experimenting in a session, but don't always wish to type file names in quotes, use:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr ''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. Any path will work<br>
See that it displays folders and files. Also notice its companion appears:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'pathGivenDr' Rn View&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. Copy a name and enter this line
<p>
If you write code or paragraphs of documentation, consider using<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'oldFile.c' Diff 1 'newFile.c'<br>
to identify lines which are missing in each version. While not as thorough as a Unix diff, if you move code or paragraphs around the results can be a lot easier to understand.
<p>
If you are an experienced J programmer, who wants to produce reports with tables including International characters, try:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display (,.'£'; '☮'; '¥'),. <"1[ 7j2": 100%~ ?3 2$ 10000
<p>
A few of these tools remember the last request which can be reinvoked with an empty argument, e.g. ''<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Load, Run, Copy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. Fetch code files for different purposes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code, Note, Edit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NB. View or edit an extension specific file
