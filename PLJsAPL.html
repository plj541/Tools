â€‹PLJsAPL is an experiment in providing the APL language in a compiled environment. I choose VB.Net primarily because of the automatic data conversion between integers and floating point numbers. The classes you create work with any .Net language.<p>

VB functions for every APL primitive are provided. Statements in immediate execution are converted to VB, compiled and executed. Edit and save commands create a class source file. One must use the compile command before loading a new workspace. The load command creates a hidden instance of the named class. All functions are executed without the need for syntax analysis.<p>

Download <a href="PLJsAPL.zip">PLJsAPL.zip</a> to a Windows machine and unzip. That file includes a ReadMe.txt which walks you through the installation.<p>
